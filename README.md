## Project Overview
This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for predicting asthma through the analysis of radiographic images. Asthma is a prevalent long-term medical condition that is often misdiagnosed due to its similarity to other respiratory conditions. This project aims to augment medical image datasets with synthetic images generated by GANs, enhancing the accuracy of early asthma diagnosis.
